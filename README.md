# What does it do?

> This script was made specifically for creating icons for iOS app development in which images different sizes (40x40, 60x60, 58x58, 87x87, 80x80, 120x120, 180x180, 1024x1024) are required to fill the given icon display criteria.

> This script will take in an image (ideally of over 1024x1024 for maximum clarity) and will create a new folder with 8 new resized images created from the given image all images in line with the needed sizes for iOS app dev.

# Additional Features

> The Settings.txt file allows for the ability to use your own custom resolutions, for example if you add 300,300 to a new line in the settings file when the script is run an additional resize file will be made at 300px x 300px.

# Running this script

> To run this script simply open your terminal and type the following

> ``` $	python3 icon_creator.py "image file path" ``` 

> where image file path is the file path of your chosen icon image (i.e. <b>/Users/john-smith/Desktop/my-icon.jpeg </b>)

>This will place a new folder in the same directory as your icon_creator.py file
